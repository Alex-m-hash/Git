[Intro]
Return to sender
Return to sender

[Verse 1]
I gave a letter to the postman
He put it in his sack
Bright and early next morning
He brought my letter back

[Chorus]
(She wrote upon it)
Return to sender
Address unknown
No such number
No such zone
We had a quarrel
A lover's spat
I write, "I'm sorry"
But my letter keeps coming back

[Verse 2]
So then I dropped it in the mailbox
And sent it special D
Bright and early next morning
It came right back to me
